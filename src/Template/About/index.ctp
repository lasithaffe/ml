                    <h3>About ManoLead</h2>

                        <p>ManoLead specializes in teaching and training leaders from all walks of life on introspective leadership. The idea of introspective leadership is built upon the practice of mindfulness (which can be more suitably termed as “introspection”) based on original Buddhist teachings. This form of mindfulness (which has no association with any religion) which originated in Sri Lanka enables practitionersto enhance their lives by following the Supernormal Eightfold Way. ManoLead is created to teach people about introspection (providing a complete understanding of the concept of mindfulness) and to allow them to experience its benefits. </p>
                        <p>The contemporary concept of mindfulness has been gaining popularity, especially among those involved in leadership positions. However, due to mistranslations and misconceptions that rose when the original concept was revealed to Western cultures in the 19th century by the British scholar Rhys Davids, recent decades have seen a proliferation on misunderstood views on mindfulness. </p>
                        <p>The original concept of mindfulness is based on the Buddhist concept of “Satipatthāna” which means introspection or awareness about self by placing attention inside. By identifying cognitive dissonance (disconnection of emotions and intellect) and exploring the self through exercises to follow the Supernormal Eightfold Way, one can achieve cognitive consonance for a unified mind, resulting in mental equilibrium. </p>
                        <p>ManoLead, backed by years of academic research into the original form of mindfulness (introspection), has developed the model “Supernormal Eightfold Way for Introspective Leadership” to guide individuals to become better leaders driven by wholesome values.</p>

Buddhist teachings, influence a leader’s own perception (vinchanna) and approaches to
leadership?” As an outcome of the research involved in the PhD program, Hewawasam
initiated ManoLead after recognizing the profound effects introspection has on
leadership.                        </p>
